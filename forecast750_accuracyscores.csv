I'm expecting a return of other financial tech companies into the market by the third quarter and a drop in the average back to the historical level of low 1% range.

077d40c5cc6eac97b956a83b8c62343eb198aee1: According to the current FAO report, 1,129,000 pigs have already been culled in China to stop the spread, and additional sources indicate that this number may already be under-reported. Although Chinese authorities claim the number of cases is dropping, many fear that the claims are a cover-up to avoid panic. The disease does not appear to be going away and has infected pigs throughout Asia and now Australia. Because there is no vaccine to prevent the disease, culling is currently the only way to stop it from spreading. Furthermore, the disease lives on contaminated materials for weeks, making it difficult to stop the spread. Some experts predict that up to 200 million pigs will be culled or die from the disease in China this year. Given the difficulty of stopping the spread of swine flu and the already large number of pigs that have been culled, I predict a very high chance that 1,200,000 or more pigs will be culled by July 1.

And the parties the regional levels seem in no hurry to resolve their issues.

However, even with that being the case, if you expand out to the 5 year chart you see that overall the value trends upwards more than down. While it is possible for the value to dip greatly, I think this forecast is the best I can do with current information and will update as the closing date draws near.

This is because with him being in power, it's even more likely he will stay in power. Even with some opposition against him, he doesn't seem to be letting off any steam or slowing down at all.

The article I have come across listed above discusses the initial approval rating for Putin, but has since dropped at the present date. Much of what Putin had initiated for Russia has taken a turn for a different route, which Russia did not have in mind. 

It appears that Russia citizens are seeing Putin as a weak leader than when he started. The citizens are seeing Putin as more of a self absorbed person in power, seeking more power. Not for Russia but for himself.

60b6e716c68361c948297ea453838fdbccad5c73: The reported numbers are certainly declining. But will they decline to below 5,000 for two consecutive weeks? That's a tough call. I'm assuming that we are basing the results on the interior ministry's total, which showed a total of 15,500 protesters for 5/18. That was down again from last week's count of 18,600. For further comparison, last November the total number of protesters was over 300,000.

It is reported that the protesters have plans for the EU elections and that will buoy the numbers for next week and the yellow jackets dispute the interior's totals as well. Overall, I am thinking that it will not fall below the 5,000 threshold in the time period, but the weekly totals will need to be followed on an ongoing basis.

One protester, Sophie Tissier, predicted that protesters would return strongly in September after a summer break. Perhaps they all just need a few weeks in the countryside to rejuvenate and will come back strong in the Autumn. Or, more likely, they'll wait for the next big thing to protest and join that movement.

The range over the last month is between 0 and 0.3 with most days comfortably residing at the 0.2 level. Its likely that without factoring in other possible geopolitical events, the threat index will probably be at 0.2 level on June 10th. The index tends to oscillate pretty quickly and so can quickly move up or down making 0.2 the ""best guess"" since it appears to be the most frequent reading. no readings above 0.3 have occurred in the past month, however if tempers really flare, I think it is within the realm of possibility, however currently with it looks remote.

The most current news coverage I could find was following his initial arrest in mid-February. Several news outlets have maintained that President Putin has said he will not influence the legal proceedings against him, so there really is no telling. I did see one article mention that he would be released prior to April 13, but I think this assumed he'd be released if no charges were formally brought against him.

I lowered my prediction for the May 1 - June 6 option because I do not believe that the Russian court system would work fast enough if the trial does begin in April to allow for a May release. Other predictors have mentioned the possible swap for Maria Butina, who awaits trial in the US in mid-April as well; however, I don't think anything will come of a proposed swap.

There have been few updates about his situation, leading me to believe this is not a high priority issue for Russia or Putin specifically. The London Court of Arbitration recently ruled against Baring Vostok, allowing Russian investors to exercise their option to buy 10% of Bank Vostochny. Calvey had previously dismissed this ruling by a Russian court, but now it seems that he will need to comply.

The power of Theresa May has been significantly threatened for a long time with the troubles in the UK surrounding the Brexit deal.  May has tried numerous avenues on brokering a deal which have all been unsuccessful, however the deal can hold out as the extension of Brexit is through October 31.   Calls continue to come in for May to resign which as of yesterday (5/8/19), she continues to  decline.  Last March, May pledged to stand down if and when Parliament ratified her Brexit withdrawal agreement but has not stated what she will do if no deal is reached.  I think that May will cling to power as long as she is able but may be ousted by her own party due to the disfavor she is causing.

May had another tumultuous week as criticism and calls for her departure continue to rise.  The last 3 of her bills for Brexit have failed and another one of her cabinet members has resigned bringing the total of 50 members of her government and 12 cabinet members over her handling of this deal.  However, the Brexit bill has been extended to 10/31 and May has clung to power thus far stating she will leave when Brexit is resolved.

c0d4a6bfece84f6f0e44cc6cbeaf14f13bafa475: While it was nearly unanimous of a vote, including members of the Fidesz party, and currently a committee is being formed to analyze what to do, I think this depends a lot more on the EU elections. Currently the EPP is polling well to remain firmly in power but if the EPP loses seats to the far right, they may decide keeping the Fidesz party, that has been drifting right, is better than losing a potential alliance. I also think any committee won't be able to concentrate on this idea until after the EU elections in late May so a decision to completely leave feels unlikely before July.The suspension may be an optics thing to distance other members of the EPP from the Fidesz while not throwing them out to retain the seats. Austria's Chancellor Kurz in the EPP currently has a government with the far right in his own country and believes in working with more extreme views than throwing them out and his influence may prevail and Merkel's wanes due to her stepping down as from leading her party in Germany. Fidesz' leader Orban also recently started backing away from the more right views (April 10).

c0d4a6bfece84f6f0e44cc6cbeaf14f13bafa475: The Fidesz party is currently polling strong for the European Parliamentary elections. It seems likely they will retain power in Hungary's delegation which will make them very appealing for the EPP to keep and even less likely for them to be expelled.

Then again reports have just surfaced that bribery of an official may have taken place. The bribery is a serious allegation that could effect the membership.

c0d4a6bfece84f6f0e44cc6cbeaf14f13bafa475: Fidesz just got handed a neat victory in the european parliament elections. There wasn't a populist sweep though and it seems Fidesz is looking for new anti-immigation alliances but the EPP does retain the largest single alliance majority which can make it harder for Fidesz to leave. the EPP on the other hand are in talks with more leftist groups that may demand Fidesz to leave entirely. Right now it's down to how negotiations with the socialist wing goes for the EPP as it seems unlikely for Fidesz to leave on their own.

Parliament dissolved Wednesday, so this indicates further that that report is staying still for the time being.

In 2018 Kim said he would stop nuclear testing and Intercontinental missile tests but there is also reports of activity at its nuclear site but for what is also unproven. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-05/kim-jong-un-s-weapon-test-may-have-included-ballistic-missile"">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-05/kim-jong-un-s-weapon-test-may-have-included-ballistic-missile</a> Thus far there is no proof that Kim has tested any intercontinental Missiles since 2017 and if any proof comes to light of another test it will violate the UN resolution policy, that doesn't however mean it will stop him from doing so anyways. I am giving it a slightly greater chance of happening because it has not happened in 2 years and there is no proof that Kim is doing anything right now other then stopping short of violating said UN policy but taking into account new activity at it Nuclear facility which could be used to process rocket fuel and the recent tests.

d7bf05800f1524b0304cc574a56496ee4a68d823: North Korea has recently stated it is ""re-thinking"" whether to resume nuclear and ballistic tests. Winter is approaching for NK and a likely famine under current sanctions and Kim is unwilling to dismantle in-front of his country. I think Kim is looking for any excuse to resume these tests and has indicated the upcoming ""war-games"" scheduled between the US and SK as a potential excuse. Kim claims Trump agreed to suspend these drills and is likely feeling cornered, So I am raising the chance for this to happen.

d7bf05800f1524b0304cc574a56496ee4a68d823: I am raising my forecast slightly as NK has recently been firing short-range ballistic missiles because of the SK and US war drills and usually responds in this fashion every time it comes around. Typically NK makes a demand for the drill to be canceled but it usually proceeds anyways. NK has warned that if the drill is not canceled it may hurt negotiations and it may resume nuclear tests and long-range missiles. I don't think the drill will be canceled and that makes it more likely that NK may fire a long-range missile before the end of Sept.

d7bf05800f1524b0304cc574a56496ee4a68d823: The latest development is the unexpected cancellation of the US-South Korean held war games to support diplomatic efforts with North Korea. The most recent meeting between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump ended in no agreement being reached. The war games historically had been conducted against repeated protest by North Korea and were in a rare move canceled, which should appease Kim Jong Un who had recently threatened to test long and medium range ballistic missiles if the war games were held. Due to continued diplomatic constraints between the two countries I am leaving this with a 15% chance of happening.

They reduced demand though several measures, but demand is set to reach 17.7 billion m3's by 2030, up from 13.4 billion m3 in 2016, which is more than the country is able to allocate. It depends on how much rain the area gets , but the level should stay close to it's recent levels.

The company is large, employing 50,000 people and worth 18 million.

20b9406297a61d840e705f17738aef2f93589cff: Biological attacks are frowned upon by everyone in the world.  While any time of violent act is often responded to in a quick manner, biological attacks are highly frowned upon by all countries of power and often met with quick punishment to those who unleashed them.  These attacks are rare and most countries will not use them.  However, biological attacks are often cheap to make and deploy, so terror groups may look to them in some regard.  With this information in mind, I would say the chance of an attack is low, but it is always a possibility given how common terror attacks have been in the last 20 years.  According to CNN, the last chemical attack was in 2018, in Syria, but was quickly met with force the US and other countries.  There has not been another documented attack since then.  For these reasons, my prediction remains low.","[0.05,0.95]","['Yes', 'No']",[0],0.005

Johnson has also agreed to tax cuts for the wealthy, appealing to many of the voters. Many also believe that Johnson has a strong track record from his time as Mayor, proving he will stand for his word. In the first round of voting Johnson received 114 votes with Hunt coming in second with just 43 votes. This is a vast difference, but with more rounds of voting it change up.

566e1b15bba95879ee15fffb90866bb48caf7598: A poll listed here from Holy Name University-Center for Research and Publications showed Yap with 53% of the vote and Evasco with 35%. There is not much information on the other candidates.

However, this poll has apparently been marred by controversy since some questions and information was left out, although the HNU-CRP director says they still stand by it. Another poll which was discovered to be completely fake showed Evasco with 56% of the vote and Yap with 15%. All of this is shown here:

So there seems to be some controversy over polls and kind of a lack of some information. I can't find too much on the other candidates polling, currently. According to the above link, ""the 45-day official campaign period for local candidates started on Friday [March 29],"" so hopefully in the coming weeks there will start to be some more reliable polling and information on more than just the two main candidates, which will allow me to update these probabilities. But both Yap and Evasco seem like strong candidates and have both served in positions of the current government. So I'm going to give them both a good chance for now and split the rest of the percentages between the other candidates, until more information and polling comes out.

I don't really see any new polling since the ones I discussed in my prior prediction.

12d6e700e3636e6006cebf54cff6530e5b7272dc: I think it is very unlikely that there will be a terrorist incident in France between November 1, 2019 and November 20, 2019 as reported by Wikipedia, because there have not been any recent major terrorist attacks in France and November has not been a month that terror attacks usually have taken place in France. For several years, terrorist attacks in France have been random in occurrence and none have taken place in November. With this fact and also increased security in the country, I think it is very very unlikely a terrorist attack will happen in France in November 2019.

12d6e700e3636e6006cebf54cff6530e5b7272dc: I am updating my prediction and increasing it a little due to a recent incident involving a package containing a bomb that was discovered in Lyon. The bomb had sharp objects and it detonated in a crowded shopping center there injuring several people. Due to this recent attack, France has increased security and is on high alert for any potential attacks, so even though there is more of a possibility of an attack occuring, I think the security measures that have been implemented will help to prevent a terrorist incident from occuring before November 20th.

The strict control of information seems like an unfortunate inevitability for many countries around the world. For Russia, it may be sooner rather than later. Russian lawmakers have just passed the 2nd reading of the bill, 320 to 15, just hours ago. With so little opposition, I believe the bill will easily pass its 3rd reading and be signed into law by Putin.

The country seems to be quite busy with formulating a new government currently. They are working on making their country run better and be more peaceful, rather than participating in attacks with other countries, as they are dealing with a lot in Sudan among their own citizens and leaders. It could happen in the future, but I do not think it's very likely to happen within this time frame.

What does surprise me is that this hasn't been a more active region for piracy given how prevalent and infamous it is in the waters off of eastern Africa. The maritime nations will now have to cover these sea lanes as well with naval units to protect mercantile ships in these heavily trafficked waters. It could be sometime though I think before adequate coverage can be obtained and the number of attacks will certainly increase as other people in the area see how much money can be made and how easy it is.

On April 5, it was announced that the Government Pension Fund Global would be allowed to invest up to $13.9 billion unlisted renewable energy infrastructure via segregated mandates. This is intended to be a small step in shifting assets from previous investments into ""smaller"" markets and assessing overall profitability of their ventures. It's important to understand that we won't see complete divestment from oil and gas, but that government is allowing the fund to seek alternatives in the near future. The change that occurred on April 5 does not guarantee that the fund will pursue renewable energy companies as their sole investment, rather that they can test the waters by investing them and seeing how profitable they are compared to keeping investments in the fossil fuel industry.

I expect that the Iranians will free some if not all of the crew of the Stena Impero. This is particularly likely given that the Gibraltar authorities (presumably under the influence of the British government) reportedly refused an American request to detain the Grace 1. The Iranians will be keen to curry favor with the British and to exploit differences in opinion among western allies.","[0.55, 0.43, 0.02]","['Yes, but not all 23 members of the crew', 'Yes, all 23 members of the crew', 'No']","[1, 0, 0]",0.129266667

I believe that he will decide at the last possible minute if he will attend this summit and may even back out of an announced decision to attend.  Kim is an extremely volatile and unpredictable person even by the present standards of world leaders.  I could easily see Kim saying he will attend and then launching another missile test the day before the summit and claiming that his enemies would assassinate him there, or something equally bizzarre.  This question will remain uncertain until the actual closing date.

The interesting thing is that the newly formed Brexit party won 32% of the votes in this election and that party was just formed in January of this year. I believe the success of the Brexit party stunned a lot of people and will have an impact on how the next Prime Minister handles the situation. Theresa May couldn't get the job done and I believe the next Prime Minister will work to make it happen.

Considering this is only a two week question, I anticipate the OMX H25 to bounce around in the 4,076-4,178 range until then.

The most recent poll has the Socialist Party increasing the lead on their closest opposition. None of the other parties are contenders - the BE have picked up momentum lately, but they are still polling in the low teens.  The difference between PSD and PS is now 16 points - which is quite a lot to overcome in such a short time.  The election is coming up soon, and the PS have both the numbers and the momentum going forward.

Which is less than the august numbers which were around 720000 or so. The 650000 or so for October is still telling an informs us better.

0d23d2fff5295c18dc05ddeae13a82920eff629c: According to The Hindu (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/an-election-dilemma-in-sri-lanka/article29779146.ece"">https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/an-election-dilemma-in-sri-lanka/article29779146.ece</a>), Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the early favorite in the presidential race and is currently one of two front runners to win the election. Rajapaksa has earned the support of the Buddhist community, the largest voting group in Sri Lanka. He also has the endorsement of many powerful and notable groups within the country and is a local favorite to many. However, a win in the Sri Lankan presidential election is still far from given. The thorn that remains in his side is his brother reputation which is still fresh in many voters' minds. Gotabaya Rajapaksa is the younger brother of the former highly controversial President Mahinda Rajapaksa. His brother served as president of Sri Lanka from 2005-2015 and has had allegations made against him ranging from rampant corruption to human rights abuses. The allegations made against him were very serious and many voters may be hesitant to put another Rajapaksa into power, despite his perceived popularity. If Rajapaksa loses, this is going to be the primary reason. His competitor, Sajith Premadasa, is definitely no push-over. According to another article by The Hindu (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-presidential-election-tna-endorses-sajith-premadasa/article29907481.ece"">https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-presidential-election-tna-endorses-sajith-premadasa/article29907481.ece</a>), Premadasa just recently received an important endorsement by Sri Lanka's main Tamil party, the Tamil National Alliance. With this endorsement, Rajapaksa likely loses on a large proportion of the Tamil and Muslim minority group, which happens to make up a quarter of the electorate. In a tight contest, which this is exactly what we have, the Tamil and Muslim votes could be crucial in determining the winner of the election. With no other candidates really having much of a chance, the election comes down to Rajapaksa and Premadasa. At this point, the election is a coin-toss and either candidate has a chance of winning. With that said, Rajapaksa has a 50% chance of receiving the most votes. Should he in fact receive the most votes, he'll likely win by a majority instead of a plurality due to the fact that this is a two-person race.","[0.35, 0.15, 0.5]","['Yes, and he will win a majority of votes', 'Yes, and he will win a plurality of votes', 'No']","[1, 0, 0]",0.231666667

Ukraine wanted to exchange 25 Russians convicted in Ukraine for Ukrainian political prisoners kept in Russia. Unfortunately, Russia is not too keen on this plan. According to the KyivPost (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/unian-ukraine-names-terms-of-swapping-25-russians-pardoning-72-separatists.html"">https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/unian-ukraine-names-terms-of-swapping-25-russians-pardoning-72-separatists.html</a>), Ukraine has attempted to sweeten the deal by claiming that it is ""ready to hand over to Russia 25 Russian nationals and grant pardon to 72 militants in exchange for 19 civilians and soldiers held in Donbas"". But, Russia has since ignored any requests or demands in connection to prisoner exchange. In fact, there has not been a successful prisoner exchange since 2017 between Russia and Ukraine. Based on these facts, it would be reasonable to assume that it would be very improbable that Ukraine and Russia would initiate a prisoner exchange before July 30, 2019. There has not been a successful exchange in over two years, and the fact that Russia is not responding to any requests is further proof that any type of prisoner exchange is highly unlikely at this point in time.

According to The New York Times (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/world/europe/Volodymyr-Zelensky-ukraine-elections.html"">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/world/europe/Volodymyr-Zelensky-ukraine-elections.html</a>), ""The comedian Volodymyr Zelensky won a landslide victory in Ukraine's presidential election, according to official results with nearly all of the votes counted, making a comic actor with no experience in government or the military the commander in chief of a country that has been at war with Russian proxies for over five years"". In addition, according to ABC News (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-officials-comedians-win-ukraine/story?id=62552468"">https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-officials-comedians-win-ukraine/story?id=62552468</a>), Russian officials have expressed satisfaction at Poroshenko's defeat and optimism about Zelensky. ""In a sign that Moscow hopes he will be easier to handle than Poroshenko, Russia's prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, congratulated Zelensky on his victory and said he believed his election offered a chance for Ukraine and Russia to improve relations"". Due to the fact that Ukraine has a new leader and Russia has expressed satisfaction with him, this may be a promising sign that relations between Ukraine and Russia may improve. With that said, the chances of a Ukraine/Russian prisoner exchange occurring may still be very unlikely, but the odds definitely have improved based on this news. My probability has been updated based on this new information on the Ukrainian election.

0d23d2fff5295c18dc05ddeae13a82920eff629c: I am updating my previous forecast on prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia. Previously, I had explained that Russian officials had expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the Ukrainian election and that it had offered a chance for Ukraine and Russia to improve their relations. Although, despite these promising signs of improved relations, I explained that it was still rather unlikely that a Ukraine/Russian prisoner exchange would occur, especially since Russia was seemingly avoiding the topic. Since my last forecast, there have been new developments regarding a prisoner exchange. According to Urdupoint (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/russia-hopes-discussion-of-prisoner-exchange-625558.html"">https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/russia-hopes-discussion-of-prisoner-exchange-625558.html</a>), Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov went on record to say that ""Russia hopes that the discussion of the exchange of prisoners with Ukraine will continue"". Also, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, at his inauguration, said that he was ready for a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia to resolve the conflict occurring in Donbas, but that the first step would be the return of held prisoners. According to 112 International (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://112.international/politics/zelensky-calls-for-exchange-of-prisoners-in-all-to-all-format-39284.html"">https://112.international/politics/zelensky-calls-for-exchange-of-prisoners-in-all-to-all-format-39284.html</a>), newly elected President Volodymyr Zelensky, called for an exchange of prisoners in ""all-to-all"" format. Zelensky went on to say that ""I emphasize once again that I am ready for negotiations. I hope that at the next meeting in the Normandy format, Russia will demonstrate readiness for de-escalation. A concrete confirmation of this readiness should be the mutual exchange of our citizens in the ""all-to-all"" format. Without exceptions."". Based on this new information, it seems much more likely that a prisoner exchange could in fact occur before July 30. Both Russia and Ukraine have demonstrated that they are willing to discuss an exchange of prisoners, which is extremely promising. My probabilities have been updated to reflect this new information.","[0.25,0.75]","['Yes', 'No']",[0],0.125

Erdogan wants both, but the U.S. says they can't accept his promise to keep the F-35 separate and safe while deploying the Russian air-defense system.  He is also aligning with China more lately besides Russia, so the U.S. will try to avoid pushing him into an embrace of Putin.  Turkey is part of NATO, and hosts extensive NATO infrastructure , as well as U.S. nuclear weapons.  The Washington Post says a wider crises will more than likely be avoided.

Although a  number of countries that aren't always friendly with the U.S. are actively developing EMP weapons, including Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, among them I dont see enough current conflict between these countries right now to think they would use a EMP against eachother. An EMP attack could prompt a world war. Its very unlikely a attack will occur anytime soon. Also countries like the US under President Trump, are taking precautions against EMP attacks. I imagine most of the countries that are a threat are doing the same. Thankfully, EMP attacks are not common at all. It would take a major conflict for a country to use one.

7540940a153bff02b111abf59e05fdfe133fde24: The three countries have reached an agreement on the USMCA deal, and it was signed by the three nation´s leaders on November 30.   In the USA, Trump has the task of pushing it past the Democrats for approval.  Mexico has already ratified the agreement, and Canada´s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is strongly supporting and pushing for the deal to be ratified.  I think it almost certainly will be ratified in Canada,  because the governing liberals and the opposition conservatives both strongly support North American free trade, and in many ways, this deal does not deviate to far from the old NAFTA deal it replaces.  Canada has an election in October 2019, and it is a sure thing that Trudeau will be pushing hard to get this deal done, to help bolster his public image before he faces elections.

7540940a153bff02b111abf59e05fdfe133fde24: I am dropping my prediction, because of statements made by U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who said recently that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is ""waiting on us"" for the U.S. House to vote on the CUSMA (USMCA) in order for them to do the same.  The House of Commons in Canada has risen for the summer break,  and  is not expected that CUSMA will be implemented into Canadian law this year.  There still may be a chance if the US decides to ratify it sooner.

077d40c5cc6eac97b956a83b8c62343eb198aee1: The latest report for the FAO sugar price was 180.4, which was down 3.8 points from the previous month. The report states this was due to larger harvests than anticipated in the main producing countries and the continued weakness of the Brazilian Real. I believe these trends are likely to continue throughout the spring and summer. A recent article states that sugar production is expected to rise 11.1% over this year and that production will surpass consumption ""by a large margin"" so I predict that prices will continue to gradually drop throughout the year.

I'd previously thought it was unlikely that he would attend. I still believe he's more focused on improving relations with the US so that sanctions will be removed. I think he is less interested in other summits and more interested in a new one with President Trump. He remains completely silent on it which in my opinion means he has no interest in attending. I'll lower my prediction to just a 5% chance.

ACLED's data shows that these types of events are quite rare, and I think they will continue to be. The historical data shows that it's unlikely this one month span will have a civilian fatality. 

Recently, in U.S. news, President Trump backed out on a retaliatory military strike targeted at Iran, citing that he was concerned about civilian deaths. However, he also claimed that he stopped the strike just ten minutes before it was launched. I think this means that Iran is on thin ice now, and any further provocation from Iran could result in a real attack from the U.S., which may very well result in civilian deaths. The chances of this happening in the next two weeks is not hugely likely though, I think, and I imagine both countries are busy trying to avoid furthering tensions.

But these were not ICBM's. I believe that the launch of such involved missiles or SLV's would be unlikely.

c675dca154229211e2c14ba5374df8183d5d6c36: Since the beginning of this year, the minimum sea ice extent on the Greenland Sea has been dropping steadily. The last reading shows 214276.8. According to experts, warm air from Europe's heat wave reached Greenland on July 29 and 30, setting temperature records at Summit Station and melting about 90 percent of the ice sheet surface from July 30 to August 3. Overall, melting this July was much higher than average, leading to more extensive bare ice and flooded snow areas. So I predict the ice extent will be less than 75,000.

6360602f414290f311dc8f1c4bd9fabf82a57a22: While strides have somewhat been made between the US and the Taliban — particularly in the arena of counterterrorism initiatives — the possibility for formal, trilateral intra-Afghan peace talks involving the US are no more likely now than they were a year ago in my mind, and they are certainly not probable to happen in the near future. 

One month removed from an ostensibly productive 16-day negotiation in Katar, the Taliban dramatically announced a spring offensive -- which predictably follows a long line of excruciatingly similar aggressive posturing between the militant group and Afghan leadership. Moreover, in addition to the unproductive communication between the two groups within the country, there continues to be an equally predictable theme of conflict between US diplomats and the Ghani government— which remains indignant at the prospect of the US brokering deals with the Taliban at all. And, meanwhile, the resulting tensions only continue to escalate. 

This same pattern has been happening over and over again, for well over a year now. Barring a near paradigm shift in cooperation between the respective groups in Afghanistan, I just don't see trilateral peace talks happening by the end of July.

However, these talks do not include the United States and thus does not make them official three-ways talks.  Representatives of the Taliban have made it clear they will not have official talks with the U.S.  With this information perhaps the informal talks in Doha could have an impact on future dealings.","[0.05,0.95]","['Yes', 'No']",[0],0.005

That happened back in January but there is no reason to believe the risk is still not going to be there from May to November. There have also been reports that Venezuela has been under reporting the number of Zika cases. Meaning that there is a chance that the risk is higher than one can imagine. So I see them keeping the number the same or increasing it later in  the year. The rainy season in the country is from May- October which goes with the criteria. That definitely will help lead to an increase as that brings about more dangers when it comes to mosquitoes. Earlier this year in February there were reports that there has been a rise in life threatening insect born diseases like Zika, Malaria and Dengue fever in Venezuela. With the current political climate getting worse as we speak and the peak rainy season on the way, that will only get worse. Meaning that there is a greater chance of a level two or higher to go up. That country is in for a rough few months both politically and health wise.

Right now the government of Canada has a level 2 for a region that contains the country of Valenzuela. That region is South America and the reason for it is Zika. The rainy season is going to take part during the months involved in this forecast. That will only increase the concerns when it comes to Zika and Malaria. Meaning that there is no way that the level will be decreases. The political unrest there is leading to a countrywide health disaster due to the lack of supplies coming in to aid the people. Thus meaning that the spread of disease will be more rampant. As long as this fiasco continues, that will also increase the level of concern for travelers there.

People are creative, especially in the face of tyranny. I think that Putin will keep this in effect as long as he thinks it's hurting Georgia. If Georgia is able to largely rebound, both by travel workarounds and travelers worldwide making Georgia a travel destination, in solidarity, this will help them deal with the financial blow as well. So, over time, if the ban becomes largely ineffective in its intent, I think he'll lift it. That will no doubt take months, but could happen before the end of November. This is one to follow and update as factors change.

I hear rhetoric from both sides but, no specific requests or guidelines to end the stand-off.  The situation was not helped by a recent Georgian radio host cruelly villifying Putin's parents. True, he received blow back even from pro-Georgian voices, but it didn't help. And although Lavrov's diplomatic tone in his statement concerning possible lifting of the ban sounds good, it's currently empty rhetoric, since 'Russophobia' could be defined as any statement made against the Russian government.  Given the diplomatic stresses here, I'm lowering my prediction from 20 to 10% chance.

15b184efd8c522294bf0cc1200bc304a86f4e6f2: A lot can happen in two months. With protests still in full swing, both sides will find new ways to antagonize the other. Right now the daily withdrawal limit stands at around $2,500 (US equivilent). What I find interesting is that the limit includes foreign currency. There are many ways the Hong Kong government could fulfill this scenario - they could limit or restrict the purchase or withdrawal of other currency to discourage migration during the protests. They could impose even minor limitations on current standard withdrawal rates. Of course, on the other side, they could maintain the current limits and use max withdrawals to identify protesters (or label anyone they want to as such...and therefore a threat to the state) it could go either way. They could also choose to impose a limit and then, after some short time, remove it as a gesture of ""good faith"" to make it seem like they are taking the situation seriously and feign bending to the will of the protesters. With so many ways to satisfy the scenario, I'm going out on a limb and saying it can truly go either way.

After going through the reelection and winning, Netanyahu has been working to shore up the government for his fifth term it seems.  However, there are still detractors and there are corruption charges that will be decided upon later in the year.  With the election though and the people who are in the government, Vox says that it is possible that they could pass legislation to protect Netanyahu from them, but I would think that unlikely because they wouldn't want to get involved in the criminal proceeding if something actually did happen.

While Netanyahu did win, there are these charges hanging over him and what appears some bitterness from opponents who really are against him and his term of prime minister.  I don't think there is a high chance of disruption but higher than I thought previously.

The President's party holds the majority in both the Lower House and the Senate.  As of right now, the Lower House has already passed the referendum and sent it the Senate for approval.  It will likely face a bit of a fight in the Senate since the President's part is short of a supermajority by a few votes.  The other party is promising to veto this constitutional change.  However, the President has proven himself able to negotiate with members of the opposite party and it is very likely that he could get a few to switch over to his side.  So I think it is very likely this referendum gets passed before May 1, 2019.  I'm only putting it at 75% because they do not have supermajority in in the Senate and there is still a reasonable chance it won't be passed before May 1.

The President has an overwhelming amount of support from voters and control of both the Lower House and Senate.  The only thing that makes me hesitate was that there was talk of a veto from members of the Senate.  The President doesn't have a super majority to override a veto in the Senate.  However, he will likely be able to sway some members of the opposition party to override any possible veto since he signed a declaration promising not to run for re-election. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/mexican-president-signs-declaration-promising-574048.html"">https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/mexican-president-signs-declaration-promising-574048.html</a>  <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-politics/mexicos-lower-house-passes-measure-to-cut-short-presidential-term-idUSKCN1QW0FC"">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-politics/mexicos-lower-house-passes-measure-to-cut-short-presidential-term-idUSKCN1QW0FC</a>  <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://thehill.com/opinion/international/433848-amlo-cant-bend-mexicos-economy-to-his-will-like-he-can-its-political"">https://thehill.com/opinion/international/433848-amlo-cant-bend-mexicos-economy-to-his-will-like-he-can-its-political</a>

1a39d8b5f308a14eec8903b87707290a22792038: I am reducing my prediction from 75% to 30% this week.  I really think that this referendum will eventually pass but I'm not too confident it will occur before May 1 anymore.  The last news I saw on the referendum was the President promising not to run for election again.  I have not been able to find any other news on it which makes me think that there isn't much else going on yet.  I'll probably keep decreasing the percentage if no more news comes out in the next week.

I think it will happen but I don't think it will happen before May 1.  Right now the White House is expecting the Mexican Senate to be working on a labor reform bill within the next couple of weeks.  I wonder if that will be the main focus for the Senate instead of the presidential recall referendum.

According to the Algemeiner, Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steintiz states that he expects an agreement to be made within 6-9 months.  A venue and specific date has not been set for the talks, but the Minister is very hopeful that the arrangements will be made soon to pave the road for peace.

They could begin in July and will mainly involve the dispute involving the maritime border.   According to the Times of Israel, the talks will not involve the dispute between land, which may be a cause for conflict.

732f7b8316a2a22e790c6603fed6d2771b36d6d2: I feel that there is a very slight chance that the government of PNG will declare the country polio free before the end of November this year.  According to the CDC.org, the organization recommends that all travelers to PNG be fully vaccinated against polio.  The current outbreak is caused by a vaccine-derived poliovirus, a sign of low vaccine coverage in the country.  To help control the outbreak, the UN is supporting the government of PNG in launching a polio campaign to vaccinate children under 5 years old in Morobe, Madang, and Eastern Highlands Provinces.  Cosmosmagazine.com states that the country has been polio free since 1996 and then the first case since was noted earlier this year.  The main factor of the outbreak is not the vaccine, the article states, but the low numbers of people receiving it.  I feel that it will take  quite a while to reach all of those young children who live in places that are primitive and hard to reach.  I believe that the country can be polio free again...it will just take lots of time.

The problem also lies in the fact that outlying areas of the country that are hard to reach have high numbers of cases and it takes much time and effort to reach those populations.

According to the CDC, travelers going to the PNG are still currently being advised to travel with caution.  Currently, the alert for the situation is at a level 2.  The CDC urges all travelers to practice enhanced precautions while traveling.

Further according to 112 Intn'l the Ukraine has demanded a date be set for the exchange during the Trilateral Contact Group meeting in March. However it appears that the major setback for this to occur is the opinion of Russian representatives believing that the issue should be resolved by the ombudsman. Should this issue be resolved an exchange will almost undoubtedly occur.","[0.75,0.25]","['Yes', 'No']",[0],1.125

b517f8011396b09fca207c6c463f3d4e79d85f0b: The rise to the majority of the Law and Justice Christian Conservative party in Poland was so swift that it is hard to imagine it losing the majority anytime soon. The voters of Poland are resolved to remain favorable toward Law and Justice but that good will could be worn out if too much drastic change unnerves the parties supporters. Already, the Law and Justice party has been waging a war to take over the Polish judiciary which some feel could threaten the constitution, courts, and rule of law. Despite seeking to make drastic changes to police, law, and government, the party remains committed to Conservative values which could have to do with why it has seen so much support to begin with. Since the Law and Justice party are essentially the incumbents, I think it is unlikely that they lose the majority in the next legislative elections in Poland.

Basically Michael Calvey is currently jailed in Russia after defrauding one of their banks. The maximum sentence for this is 10 years there. I believe that he will either be in there for the full 10 years or potentially even ""accidentally"" die in Russia considering how brutal they can be with punishments. There's always the very tiny chance of him getting released before then but I doubt it.

This series of events seems to be triggered by the UK seizing an Iranian tanker that was apparently destined for Syria, which is sanctioned by the EU. I don't see any of these issues getting resolved soon.

f8690cda838a4857a9d8ffe8b893cf29c4d7d178: As of now the Stena Impero is still being held. It's not clear what Iran is doing - is it still investigating the tanker or is it trying to use it as political leverage to get some sort of concession? Recently Iran's president Rouhani turned down a chance to meet with Trump, saying he wouldn't do it unless the sanctions were lifted. The tanker seems to be caught in the middle of this stalemate.

Because an outbreak within a country's borders does not constitute an international emergency, it is highly unlikely that a PHEIC related to this issue will be declared in the next six weeks. In 2019, the only location reporting the Ebloa virus was the Democratic Republic of Congo. Measles, on the other hand, has crossed borders and has been reported in Tunisia, the Western Pacific Region, the European Region. On May 7, the WHO provided a disease outbreak update that read ""a resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO Regions."" That said, they have not made a recommendation towards ""compulsory vaccination, travel restrictions, or border screening for measles.""

News reports dated Nov. 1 stated that Adil Abdul-Mahdi, the embattled prime minister, announced that he would resign on condition that a successor be named to replace him. The country's political parties, represented in Parliament, must agree on his replacement, according to reports. Whether this happens by Nov. 29 is highly uncertain, probably unlikely, so he remains PM for the near future. U.S. military leaders reportedly are skeptical Abdul-Mahdi will actually leave office or give in to protesters' demands.

I am making a final forecast where I think there is a good chance it stays in that range at time of close.  However, since it has been quite volatile over the last month, if there is a drastic change, I could see it falling further as it has been in the low range of 4060.

For this one, I'm tempted to literally roll a dice and give a 30% chance for one value and 17 ish for the rest.

With the amount of talk about human rights abuses in North Korea and it's peacocking on the global stage with its ICBMs, I think it is very possible that the arrest or assassination of the North Korean leader is a very real threat if he were to leave his own borders. Some countries may be willing (US included) to see it as an opportunity to take Kim Jong Un out even if they have to do it covertly through a proxy, and install a new regime that will play ball when it comes to not having nuclear weapons.

66f8aaf95b42f131fe8c4875ec110ea8f91f18a6: As unrest continues in Hong Kong, protesters are trying a new tactic. Hong Kong protesters are calling for massive ATM withdrawals in an attempt to drain banks of currency as an economic warning to China. They hope that through so many cash withdrawals, it will force banks to run out of cash and to pressure the dollar's fixed exchange rate. Despite their attempt, Hong Kong banks have stated that they can easily handle the money withdrawals and that there is no concern about running out of bank notes. According to banks, ATM's already have a $20,000-$40,000 daily withdrawal limit, which is more than enough to prevent banks from running out of cash. They have indicated that they are well prepared for such a scenario and have pledged to support its customers by ensuring that they have a sufficient supply of banknotes. Because of this, it is very unlikely that Hong Kong will limit or ban cash withdrawals from banks. The banks seem well prepared as-is, and it is unlikely that the Chinese government would even allow banks to run out of cash anyways. Also, there are already limits in place on ATM's, and it seems unnecessary for banks to increase or set new limits. There is very low probability that banks will add additional limits or ban cash withdrawals entirely between September 19 and November 29.

The officials at these levels are the ones the Russian people blame for their daily woes. They look to Putin to increase international prestige. Therefore I think popular support for the Russian government to stay consistent around 45%.

15e21ed9663d4e00f1f5f42985f9229b9d9020e0: So the reason that I am carrying the weight in the last two options are because of how the events have unfolded. A couple things that we should note from the very informative NYT article <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/world/africa/algeria-bouteflika-what-now.html"">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/world/africa/algeria-bouteflika-what-now.html</a> is that the protestors have won a major battle getting the old president to resign. Because of this I am saying they have gotten what they want once and probably won't stand for getting much less for what they want again and again. They are asking for a clean slate which is why I put a 65 percent that it will not be someone from the RND or FLN as they are calling for a total makeover. Don't forget that they had backing from the Army Chief of staff who was an ally to the president. HOWEVER, I weighed 25 percent that elections won't be held before July because despite winning this, protestors have to convince that they want new change which is hard to scrap everything and go really rogue. So I gave 5 percent to each party for the short mean time that they might just not listen to the protestors and then re-elect someone with the parties. The 25 percent comes from the chance that they will just protest that too.

15e21ed9663d4e00f1f5f42985f9229b9d9020e0: I've changed my answers quite a bit since the last time I answered this question.

The elections are meant to be held July 4th 

I also read this article that really gave us a lot of information. I keep 10 percent at hosting no election because the protests are continuing to proceed which always provides uncertainty or doubt of what will happen but it seems according to this article the popularity has shifted towards the FLN and the second priority is a member  of neither party because with protests going on there is the possibility that a complete overthrow does happen.

feba6274eb948e69dfb64b22f534bdc267ae4f9e: The hypocrisy of having a conference of torture in a country that commits the same acts and other human rights violation and that the U.N was even willing to is sort of mind blowing to even begin with especially after the murder of Khashoggi and Egypt agreement with the Saudi's response to it, plus the fact that they also have committed torture and human rights violations themselves.  I do highly doubt the U.N would hold the conference in Egypt after all the backlash, I do feel it will be held in another country, my only doubt is if the date will be set by November 29th.

Brent Crude is currently rebounding after a rough performance in December of last year. It has been going back up pretty steadily. Barring a huge advancement in green energy or a devastation to oil reserves, there is no reason to believe it will drop significantly or jump in price. It should remain steady and have a gradual rise and periods of being stagnant.

I am sure that protesting that costs the account holder money is likely to stop the AMT abuse too.

I believe those who could leave Syria have left, and there are not many welcoming places to absorb refugees because resources are already strained. I think there is some possibility the number of refugees will go up, but not by much.

In January 2019, the Prime Minister announced that in order to lift the tariffs on Serbian goods, they wanted a final, comprehensive agreement with Belgrade about Kosovo's status.  Nothing has occured with this and with Serbia and Bosnia threatening countermeasures, I think that Kosovo may fold with the plan with tariffs as it is also hurting Kosovians.

In April 2019, European Leaders held talks with the leaders of Serbia and Kosovo seeking to reduce tensions.  It was reported that another meeting will be held on July 1.  Following the meeting, European leaders tamped down expectations for quick progress.  Given this information, I find that it is unlikely that there will be progress in reducing the tarrifs in the next month.","[0.02, 0.02, 0.17, 0.79]","['Yes, on Serbian goods only', 'Yes, on Bosnian goods only', 'Yes, on both Serbian and Bosnian goods', 'No']","[0, 0, 0, 1]",0.01845

Unfortunately, I don't hold much hope for her release before 30 November 2019. At the time of Adelkhah's arrests, France and other European countries were trying to save a nuclear deal with Iran, which is close to collapse after the Islamic Republic breached several commitments in response to reinstated US sanctions. There will need to be a trial and word as of now is that she has been denied access to an attorney. Just as an example, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has been jailed in Tehran since 2016 on espionage charges. The UK has advises dual nationals against travel to Iran, saying the ""dangers they face include arbitrary detention and lack of access to basic legal rights"".

If I based my judgement on Wikipedia, I would have to say there will be at least 3 power outages, but the odds for more than 3 power outages between these months are still likely to occur. 

It is stated that on June 16, 2019, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, were affected by entire power outages. 

I would have to assume that between the dates listed in the question, there will be at least 3 outages an a slight chance of more than 3 outages happening.

0a19a4523e7accb2d92e2feaac1773d16e7935e0: The downward slope of Croatia's unemployment rate is quite lovely¹, especially if it keeps going down, as I think it will.  

There seems to be some discrepancy with measurement, where some articles note the rate as being some percentage points higher, for example in April.²  

Given that the official Eurostat page is 1-2% lower, August should be safely at 7% or under, especially with the optimistic Summer outlook³, where it is noted the current unemployment rate is at a record setting low of 7% already!

The March 2018 report details the outbreak affecting the region of Kinshasa and notes that there has been a downward trend in the weekly incidences of the disease since January 2018.

a09e029548f560bdc101f2f7c6c51a147eecdee3: I think the  chance of Canada issuing a travel advisory of ""avoid non-essential travel"" or ""avoid all travel"" between May 23, 2019 and August 21, 2019 is almost 50-50. With diplomatic tensions between Canada and China on the rise with the death sentence of a Canadian citizen, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg for allegedly attempting to smuggle methamphetamine, and the arrest of two Canadians that was an act of Chinese retailation, I think the chance of a higher threat level could happen. The situation is unpredictable and China could continue to retaliate against Canada.

Mr. Putin's rating spiral started when he,"" raised the pension eligibility age to 65 for men and 60 for women"" falling household incomes is another factor in his steep ratings decline. Mr. Putin has gone from a 87% approval rating in the aftermath of the annexing of Crimea to ""just 32 percent, that's according to a survey by the All-Russian Public Opinion Research Center."" There is another report from Dozhd- Independent Russian TV that states,"" ""People have grown weary of missiles,"" one of its sources is saying.

In my opinion his strong showing in Venezuela his meeting with North Korean Dictator Kim and, another meeting with President Trump, during the G-20 planned this may be the wind needed for him to move upward in the polls. The actions he has been undertaking has brought Russia to the forefront of world politics, and may be good for local consumption in Russia

The Levada Center shows that for April and May Vladimir Putin's Approval Number was at 66%, but there is another factor that can boost his approval rating for July. His trust numbers are way up. ""VTsIOM published new figures showing trust in Putin skyrocketing to 72.3 percent after the Kremlin's criticism"" of the previous poll. In my opinion I feel there could be a correlation between Putin's Trust and approval ratings in the upcoming weeks that could boost Mr. Putin's approval rating over 75% by July.

Mr. Putin's recent score is still in the 60's at 65.8%, while this not a bad score for any world leader without any drastic events in my opinion, will not go to the 75% range  this month. Putin's main sticking point for his domestic approval is the economy.

f5af256bce957a767cd2a985da74b229c86ad67e: With the Turkish buying missiles from Russia, it seems that Russia's influence in the area is having strangely enough a calming effect on the area. I don't see any red flags that any attacks in Turkey are going to be happening in the near future. It's near the end of the timeline for this question, so I can be fairly certain of things being fairly stable. As Turkey is having economic issues currently, I think most Turkish people's attention will be focused on that rather than outward.

The number of outages per year (as calculated on this Wikipedia page) vary greatly, so I'm left with having to guess.

Investing in gold is always a safe bet. Last week, the price hovered in the $1,300 range. This week, the price is hovering in the $1,400 range. It seems likely it will remain above $1,400, but I'm hedging my bet by selecting a 30% chance it could be between $1,320 and $1,400.

Events like the recent transit of Chinese warships through the Taiwan Strait and a recent announcement of a new Chinese missile will probably continue and perhaps even increase. I have little doubt that at some point China intends to make good on it's threats, but not in the next few weeks.

849ef15be196667fed0c5e4cc4d9ec174a3771e5: Biological warfare is so intricate and detailed. There's a reason why it hasn't occurred since 1995. For it to happen again before the end of November is very, very unlikely. Will there be other types of attacks? Much more likely. Bombs, guns, etc... are all easier than pulling off a biological attack of any sorts.

a56aa96d20328fb57fc507b8de2adf9c2aa1fcf8: From my quick research, I've found out that this has actually been attempted once before back when Iran threatened to close the straight just this past April. However, no action was taken back then which makes me believe that if such a threat arises again, that it won't be acted on. There's still a decent amount of time left until July 20th, so I'll be sure to follow this closely and make any necessary changes to my forecast as more news comes about.

I expect this season to unfortunately see a larger number of earthquakes.

However, given the inconsistency with like events for the same period a year ago, it's quite possible the data, and the reason for the long resolve time on the question, is because not all events are reported in a timely manner.

It's muddy and tenuous at this point. No, I don't think either side wants things to escalate to armed conflict, but things are unstable enough that it could come to that. Let's hope not.

However, since it does need at least 308 votes in two rounds, there is still a chance that it will fail.

5214ed564cda021c5b077e3597d89c5e4e619a5f: Boris Johnson was just elected and is going to hold onto power for a long time. As he promised, Britain will leave the EU with no deal and nobody will be surprised. However, a no deal departure could spark mass chaos and if so, the people may turn against him. Either way, it's highly unlikely that he faces a leadership disruption. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/08/18/leaked-memo-says-britain-faces-economic-social-chaos-if-it-goes-through-with-no-deal-brexit/?noredirect=on"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/08/18/leaked-memo-says-britain-faces-economic-social-chaos-if-it-goes-through-with-no-deal-brexit/?noredirect=on</a>

The European Coalition came in just behind with 38% of the votes. The Law and Justice party has been in power since 2015 in Poland and has generally done well in terms of creating economic growth and benefits to the people of Poland. All of this points to a win for the PIS in the upcoming elections.

1b906e8e8e951ffa6eb115f5b77e335d6c670c64: Tensions within Iran are ramping up as the year progresses, and the nuclear deals are falling apart. It is reasonable to expect civilians will be the likely targets of violence in the coming months. To average the hostilities in 2019 so far, 29 have been killed and another 18 have been injured. The primary source of deaths have been by the group Jaish-al-Adl in the Sistan and Baluchestan province of Iran. All of these numbers mainly stem from one incident in February also. In comparison the numbers for attacks in the United States are well above those in Iran. So estimating between a one month period this summer, Iran might be fairly safe all things considered, have to wait and see.

Now it is important to take note that all around Iran there are many incidents taking place, primarily in Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. But Iran is holding their own right now in well comparison to their neighbors. Coming into the next couple of months falling within the deadline of this question, it will be interesting to see how the whole nuclear deal pans out and if that causes any problems with the EU and US negotiations.

There have been upwards of 30 peaceful protests that have resulted in not a single fatality. There have been no terrorism incidents that caused loss of life. There was a military altercation on the 20th of June and a riot with the police in Tehran on the 25th of June, but nobody was killed in either case. Data seems quite for the month of July however, maybe because the month is still in progress and a batch of data will be dumped at the conclusion of the month as a means of controlling propaganda. I'll revise my previous forecast now that the deadline is getting close.

I believe that a deadly attack is unlikely before the question closing.

Which isn't to say cholera isn't going to happen, but there are no DONs worldwide for cholera so far this year yet. March 2, 2018 is the last cholera DON for the Congo, with 2018 DONs in other African countries since then including Somalia, Cameroon, Algeria, Niger and Zimbabwe. I think there is a little less than 25% chance we'll see a DON for cholera in the Congo before 25 May 2019.

On Monday a man and woman were killed in a car accident earlier that day and both parties blamed the other and it appears to be an accident.","[0.56,0.43999999999999995]","['Yes', 'No']",[0],0.6272

Under Macron, there has been a rise in jobs and some jobs that people aren't taking, but nonetheless there is more work available. August is shaping up to be a very good month for French employers and employment levels should continue to rise as reforms are working their magic.

c1116a1595f790297f6e82b32d7d5f93d2490885: It seems extremely unlikely that President Anastasiades will experience a significant leadership disruption by November 29th. Cyprus has been dealing with ethnic issues with the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots. Since Turkey is currently trying to put soldiers on the border to help address the unrest and the President is strongly against that (something that 2/3 of the nation agree with), the issue is likely to remain between the President and Turkey as opposed to the President and unrest wit his citizens.

A trade and diplomatic dispute between two of the world's top makers of hi-tech products has just hit a new low. On Wednesday, Japan officially kicked South Korea off a list of favoured destinations for exports of components and materials used in smartphones and computer chips.

Japan's cabinet approved the move on August 2.

Japan's new restrictions could at least temporarily damage technology-related supply chains around the world, possibly affecting companies ranging from Apple in the United States to ZTE in China.

In response, South Korean President Moon Jae-in immediately pledged to take ""corresponding"" countermeasures for what he described as a ""reckless"" and ""selfish"" decision by Japan.

South Korean officials revealed that Seoul would expedite its preparations to challenge the Japanese measures at the World Trade Organization, and also review whether to continue exchanging military information with Japan — a key element in the current tripartite security cooperation with the United States.

""The Japanese government is responsible for having made the situation worse by ignoring the Korean government and the international community's efforts to diplomatically resolve the issue,"" Moon was quoted as saying by the Yonhap news agency at an emergency Cabinet meeting.

The most major developent I see, which isn't really - it's more of an indicator of where things are - is this line from the link located at the bottom of this updated forecast:
""In late September, a delegation from the Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy and the Blue and White National Unity traveled to Washington to meet with US congress people and members of the High-Level Commission on Nicaragua of the Organization of American States (OAS), which Ortega banned from entering the country in mid-September.""
Basically, this shows to me, along with the lack of news and movement in talks, that we are seeing a much slimmer chance of this happening before the end of November, so I am updating my forecast to reflect this.

But the situation remains tense so it bears monitoring.  <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://vancouversun.com/opinion/op-ed/thoms-knapp-a-nuclear-freeze-in-north-korea-is-finally-a-realistic-proposal"">https://vancouversun.com/opinion/op-ed/thoms-knapp-a-nuclear-freeze-in-north-korea-is-finally-a-realistic-proposal</a> <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-north-koreas-kim-wants-to-join-him-at-the-dmz/2019/06/29/ef99dc98-9a99-11e9-830a-21b9b36b64ad_story.html?utm_term=.54e4e9d7d2ce"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-north-koreas-kim-wants-to-join-him-at-the-dmz/2019/06/29/ef99dc98-9a99-11e9-830a-21b9b36b64ad_story.html?utm_term=.54e4e9d7d2ce</a>","[0.01,0.99]","['Yes', 'No']",[0],0.0002

The Trump administration has put the pressure on Mexico and Canada to sign his new deal.  Mexico seems to be willing to take the stance of the complient and happy deal maker with the Trump administration, while Canada appears to be be a very unwilling partner in the spectacle that is a Trump deal.  Trudeau is wincing at every turn when he has to interact with the president.  The biggest change in the agreement is  the nature of our partnerships with all trading partners regarding the car manufacturing market place.   Canada is making it's issues with the deal known, while Mexico is heaping awards and praise on the Trumps and the Trump administration.

Canada has moved closer to signing the bill.  They put safeguards on the bill earlier and they need the US and Mexico, I don't believe they have any other options.

The most recent indications of American intentions suggest that the President is growing wary of John Bolton's super-hawkish approach, thus lowering the immediate threat level somewhat.

Looking at the interest by region and the ""related topics"" section, it seems like a lot of the search terms for sabotage were somehow related to Saudi Arabia and oil tankers.

Looking over the past year, it seems like there were 2 months, almost 3 if taking into account the increase from 54-100 in Sept 2018 where there was a day to day increase of over 50 points. So that let's say, 2.5/12 months is about 21%. It seems like a lot of different events could be related to the word sabotage.

22eeca4e64528baaf85e499fa3a20a370d975671: Saudi Arabia remains committed to cutting oil production. They are cutting oil production more than that required by the current OPEC agreements. Even with these cuts there is likely to be an oversupply in 2020. They might try to cut production even more.

22eeca4e64528baaf85e499fa3a20a370d975671: Saudi Arabia has previously shown a tendency to cut production more than the agreed upon levels. As global oil demand has been revised downward they would be expected to decrease production again. They have recently award contracts to boost output at two offshore deposits. However, these are not going to come online for years.

22eeca4e64528baaf85e499fa3a20a370d975671: Saudi Arabia has dropped production to 9.67 bpd in May. They will be exporting more to some countries including China in the next few months. The drop in Iranian oil exports will lead to Saudi Arabia picking up the slack. However, they still are committed to production reduction and are thus likely to only increase a small amount.

22eeca4e64528baaf85e499fa3a20a370d975671: Saudi Arabia actually increased production  in August. However, they still are keeping their production even lower than the amounts agreed to by OPEC. Now Saudi Arabia is having to decide if they will produce to provide for China. This would push prices lower and Saudi Arabia is already trying to push prices up to $80 a barrel.

The price has been slowly trending upwards so I can forsee the price ranging from $60 to $72.

Last week, the FLN elected a new more youthful leader, Djemai, to lead the ailing party after Bouteflika and many others exited. The FLN is facing many crackdowns and even Bensalah faces resignation demands. The RND, like the FLN has the support of the army and the political elites, without  all of the current taint. The protest movement is strong, and if they can organize (unlikely) and agree on a worthy leader they could stand a chance in July, although they lack critical support from Europe and the US.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) recently released a short video showing its troops practicing anti-riot exercises. Many believed that this is a warning to the rioters. So I believe there is a good possibility that troops will be deployed if the rioting and protests don't end soon.

In September 2018 there were 157 homicides in Mexico City.  In April, the NY Post published an article that stated the homicide rates were rising in Mexico. The new president vowed to decrease the violence, but so far it has not been very successful. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador feels that the effects of his programs to end violence will not be fully observable until October. I think the homicide rates are likely to stay high but might drop slightly from these new policies.

639ed80695f1da62020c43ca726b7a1b480fd46a: Since my last forecast, the homicide numbers for June and July in Mexico City have been posted. There were 183 reported homicides in the city for June and 206 for July. The most common range so far this year has been ""More than 198"" with 5 of the 7 months reported falling into this category. The remaining two months fall into the category ""Between 184 and 198"". I would like to update my forecast to reflect the likelihood that the numbers will fall into one of these two categories.

This is the lowest number reported since the beginning of the year. The totals for the year so far have been 203, 172, 238, 187, 227, 162, 179, and 159.  The average is 190.8 homicides a month, but the last 3 months have been below average, so I believe that this month will also be a bit below average.","[0.0, 0.45, 0.42, 0.13, 0.0]","['Less than 152', 'Between 152 and 170, inclusive', 'More than 170 but less than 184', 'Between 184 and 198, inclusive', 'More than 198']","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",0.09916

95727ea97c618bc977aed4accfc5b815a782d94f: The last updated travel advisory for New Zealand was listed on March 19, 2019 as ""Take normal security precautions,"" and this is still valid on April 4, 2019. Mind you, this update came 4 days after the Christchurch terrorist attack that resulted in multiple deaths and injuries. It is important to understand that the Christchurch terrorist attack was opportunistic and took advantage of the country when law enforcement and the general public were complacent. Now that the entire country is on edge, the likelihood of follow-up attacks is minimal. New Zealand is considered a relatively safe country and it is unlikely that the Canadian government will adjust their travel advisory unless another terrorist incident were to occur in the near future. New Zealand's national terrorism threat level is still considered ""High"" by local government authorities: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://dpmc.govt.nz/our-programmes/national-security-and-intelligence/national-security/counter-terrorism"">https://dpmc.govt.nz/our-programmes/national-security-and-intelligence/national-security/counter-terrorism</a>.

This makes it more difficult for the spread of propaganda and hate speech. When you consider the heightened presence of law enforcement and vigilance of local authorities, New Zealand is a fairly safe destination for travelers.

Therefore I think that the rates will be around the 7.0-7.5 mark since it is only a couple of months away from August. Unless something major happens to the economy of Croatia, the unemployment rate will remain around the 7-7.5 mark.

He has reportedly been the target of several foiled assassination and coup plots. These led Salva Kiir Mayardit to take aggressive, violent steps to consolidate his own power, up to and including dismissing high ranking members of the armed forces and murdering journalists. While the threat of violence looms as a possible source of disruption, there are no democratic threats to his presidency and he appears to be in good health.

58ecd0032aa2d21bcd85dca01180244bf785b2c8: I think it would be extremely unlikely for a biological attack to take place between April 4 and November 27, 2019. Although there is always a threat of biological warfare I find that currently there is no credible evidence that an attack is imminent. I also think that countries would be unwilling to take the risk of using biological weapons because it would have severe and profound implications for their country. There is a small chance that an individual terrorist might use a biological weapon however I think the chance is very low.

Historically biological attacks are low. Offensive biological warfare, including mass production, stockpiling, and use of biological weapons, was outlawed by the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC).This treaty was ratified or acceded to by 170 countries as of April 2013. I feel because of the consequences of using biological weapons the only entity that would use such a a weapon would be a terrorist organization or an individual. I think the likelihood of this happening if very low. There are no indications that such an incident will occur in the near future.

The US is already putting them on notice by pulling out of the INF Treaty due to Russia not complying with it. This show of military power seems to be more for show than anything, and since tensions are already poor with them, the US, and most of Europe, I see no reason for them to push things further by deploying one of these missiles in the Kaliningard Oblast. That is why I think there is a very slim chance of that happening before July 30 2019.

Nicos Anastasiades has a meeting scheduled with the UN Secretary General in order to discuss the issues with Turkey. The fact that he is meeting with the UN shows he is seeking a diplomatic solution, which makes a war that could cause a leadership disruption unlikely. The Saudi Foreign Minister discussed wanting to strengthen ties with Cyprus. If this relationship blossoms, Cyprus will have another powerful ally. This would make a leadership disruption unlikely.

c2fec165302db5d0c35ca26382f36bf58ddaae29: The situation in Cyprus seems to be stable since the latest discussions have centered around turning a resort into what is being termed, ""New Las Vegas"". Cyprus continues to look to attract foreign dollars through improving their economy and leisure travel destinations. A leadership disruption at this growing and prosperous time seems very unlikely at this time and the percentage has been adjusted down accordingly.

According to the link provided, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://maps.clb.org.hk/strikes/en#"">https://maps.clb.org.hk/strikes/en#</a>, there have 616 strikes and worker protests in 2019 so far. That averages out to about 102 events per month or over a month long span. But the number of events has been steadily increasing over the past 3 months, from 97 in March to 114 in April and 123 such events in May. It makes sense that as summer starts, there would be more strikes and protests occurring. So I think that the answer with the highest probability would be more than 109 but less than 134 but a higher number of events reported is still likely depending on what is reported during June and July.

The fact that the situation in the United States is already deemed a crisis, means that people at least in the United States, will be causing an increase in searches related to African Swine Fever. The situation is not just contained to the United States and Asia. Experts have described the situation as one that will impact the global pork market for many years. There is a drop in hog numbers in China and it has been said it will probably bottom out before the end of the year because of government policies to combat African swine fever and that the worst may soon be over. That doesn't mean that this forecast shouldn't be followed closely because just a few days ago it was also reported U.S. authorities have started active preparations in response to the rising threat of an outbreak of African swine fever, the deadly disease that has decimated the Chinese pig population and is spreading across Asia. This could possibly take a turn the other way. The Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service led several functional exercises and drills late last month, working off a scenario of an outbreak of the virus in Mississippi that traveled across state lines before it was discovered.","[0.73,0.27]","['Yes', 'No']",[1],0.1458

Its leader wants to portray himself as a good person who is willing to change the way leadership is handled in North Korea. This makes it hard for the country to launch ICBM as this may taint its image to the international community. I do believe that North Korea truly cares about its image to the international community. This means that it will resist any temptation to do anything that may taint its image. That is why I have given it a 1% chance even as I watch closely.

It's no longer that country that wants to stay on its own, but the one that is seeking western allies. I think this makes it difficult for them to launch a missile as this may taint their image internationally.

1b906e8e8e951ffa6eb115f5b77e335d6c670c64: The latest data here had an update on the 4th of November and the petrol price in Kenya was sitting at 112.680 per liter. So where the question drops off is a little bit difficult seeing as how the threshold from one tier to another is literally where the pricing is at. The 112.68 has held since 19th of August, 2019 but just a week before the price had been hovering at 115.54. So if the price for this time of year goes a little far up, this is where I'll be staking my prediction.

81fbc01162220b5be002d3b297cc5e9189096e3e: Hijackings and criminal occurrences on flights are still a thing, apparently. In 2018, per the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), there were 6 occurrences - split between their category of ""H"" for hijacking and ""C"" for criminal occurrence. In 2019, 4 of these specified occurrences have taken place. 

Because these types of occurrences are still present, it's inevitable that it will occur in the future. This forecast is asking for a specified timeframe of 30 days which is a narrow timeframe to make such a prediction. Due to the narrow timeframe I am estimating my forecast at 15%.

The aircraft was unregistered. (link: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20190518-0"">https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20190518-0</a>).

This trend began back at the end of January/beginning of February 2019, so I think it's safe to say that it isn't a short term happening. If this keeps going or even if it levels out or decreases slightly, I think there is the highest chance that the value will be at least 3.963 and probably more than 4.041.","[0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.35, 0.55]","['Less than 3.818', 'Between 3.818 and 3.896, inclusive', 'More than 3.896 but less than 3.963', 'Between 3.963 and 4.041, inclusive', 'More than 4.041']","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0.28192

0b81277c375a99fb705e774878bb2def32594dee: Currently set at ""Exercise a high degree of caution"", Canada has set its travel advisory based on the level of crime in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is now openly trying to attract investment, tourists, businesses. [2] Less political, terrorist, or health-related issues, it seems unlikely For Canada to raise its advisory before October 23, 2019, and I have set my probability to reflect this belief.

0b81277c375a99fb705e774878bb2def32594dee: Canada's current ""Exercise a high degree of caution"" advisory stems mostly due to the crime rate of Kazakhstan. While snow storms are currently forecast,[2] no real tangible news that would hinder travel, seem to be developing. The U.S. has even gone so far as to encourage the country to improve human rights. With 2 days left in the challenge, I have lowered my probability to reflect the current situation.

So I feel that there is a good chance for the price to go up. I have also checked on the price of the 5 years price of platinum, it is generally steady within the range of 800-100 since 2018. So I feel like the price will be mostly under 1000 for sure but it will not be below 850

3195d029398d1343b8441bc22f84736dd97e9b2c: Given that the price has had a huge increase recently which pushed it to average 950, and the targeted date is within 2 months, I think the price will not really have that big of a change and the average price will stay around the 930-950 range. It may still go higher due to the distribution of mining in South Africa, it reduced the platinum supply and it can push the price go up. Also the demand is getting higher too based on the automative sector in Europe, and platinum price goes up and down with the auto industry. So I don't think the price will drop much but rather go higher from now.

However, based on the information I found, looks like the demand of platinum is still strong. Also, compare to the overall performance, for the quarter, the price of Platinum has increased 6% overall, and the market of Dollar looks stable too, so I think it will stay stable within the 850-920 range.

He has made a number of political moves in the last week or so which makes it seem like he is trying to hang on.  I don't think he is going anywhere willingly, anyway.  The system seems broken and there is no way to completely fix it, which is something Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi acknowledges - but the concessions he has made seem to be calming the people down.  I think he will be safe until the end of November, which is coming up quite soon.

The protesters want him out and there is a lot of pressure for him to resign.  According to a NYT article ""Iraq's prime minister appeared likely Wednesday to step down in the coming days.""  I believe he will absolutely step down, but the only question is whether it will happen by the end of November.  Based on the amount of pressure, I think he will be gone within a few weeks.

Because the last week there have been 3 attacks on random locations, such as <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo/east-congo-villagers-kill-ebola-health-worker-loot-clinic-idUSKCN1SY200"">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo/east-congo-villagers-kill-ebola-health-worker-loot-clinic-idUSKCN1SY200</a>

Second, it encourages and arouses national sentiment by reminding the Bougainvillean people of their dependence.  

Whether or not the PNG government allows secession, a vote for independence brings Bougainville into the spotlight and will require PNG to address the region's concerns.

374b9579e91afa56de30c619c924fb07665d767b: The price of gold has been on the rise since my previous forecast in July. As of August 23, the price was $I525. I believe talks of recession have led investors to put more of their money into gold raising the overall value.

374b9579e91afa56de30c619c924fb07665d767b: The current gold price per ounce as of October 13 is $ 1,491.46. Since late July gold has been on the rise. August numbers were well within the 1480 and 1600 range. And we saw September mostly following this trend, but lower at times. I did notice an end of month dip in price trend so I am accounting for that in my forecast.

1434ea201efe86fe127988045cdf2443f6cf2d45: Since the beginning of 2015, ACLED has recorded an average of 3 violence against civilian events, or explosion/remote violence against citizen violence, per year. Since the beginning of 2017, there has been an average of 5 such events. The average time between events, since October 2016 has been around 73 days between events. The last event recorded was June 2, 2019. 73 days from June 2, 2019 is around August 14, 2019. Thus, it seems likely that such an event would occur in Benin in the next 30 days. Therefore, I would assign about a 68% probability of such an event occurring.  In addition, there has been a recent crackdown on free speech and rights in Benin and the president recently jailed a former president while taking more authoritarian control over the country. Thus, there is a tendency for protests and violence in Benin with fatailities.

They have just elected a new president and things are off to a rocky start with the new administration.

Nigeria has been quite diligent in taking care to prevent such cases, while areas like Pakistan have experienced cases of WPV1 have occurred, given the slow spread of this specific virus, I feel that it is very unlikely that one will occur in Nigeria in this time frame and they will remain free of any confirmed cases.

The head of M15 still believe that UK and Europe are facing terrorism threat despites ISIS being wiped out. It is unlikely that we will see them downgrading the threat level anytime soon. However, will they upgrade it to Critical from Severe will be hard to predict.

With one third of the month in the books and only 4 that have the met criteria, I don't see my original forecast happening. There would have to be a huge upturn in the nest few weeks for that. So I am going to change my forecast to fit what has gone on so far this month. Will update if anything changes.

f5af256bce957a767cd2a985da74b229c86ad67e: Although piracy used to be very problematic in the South China Sea, it has reduced in the last couple of years. There were no reports of incidents between June 24 and July 24 in 2017 or 2018. With the South China Sea becoming a hotbed for military activity, perhaps pirates are finding the other places such as the Gulf of Guinea easier for finding targets. As China has raised the threat level to implement Security Level 3 for Chinese flagged ships in the Straits of Malacca, there is a chance that something will still occur before July 24th.

China has even gone as far as to release a video showing Chinese military officers sliding down ropes from a helicopter, driving armored personnel carriers, and shooting missiles against a backdrop of dramatic music.  The protests are not getting better so, at this point, it seems to be only a matter of time before the PLA is mobilize.

After a short period of relative calmness violence returned to the area as the police fired tear gas and protesters threw stones and gasoline bombs.  The protests are starting to become more violent with protestors squaring off against officers and, in response, police firing tear gas at the protestors with one officer firing live ammo into the crowds, marking the first use of a firearm at the protests.  I believe that the protests are likely to continue until some of the demands are met or China acts to end them with force.   This will be one to watch as China will be celebrating the 70th anniversary of Communist rule on 10/1 with a massive military parade scheduled to take place in Beijing

Part of the trouble stems from the loss of substantial oil revenue after South Sudan became independent in 2011. But much of the misery is the result of excessive spending on the military and security services. A deeper crisis began last year when the government cut wheat subsidies without helping the hardest-hit poor, while simultaneously devaluing the currency. Inflation has skyrocketed to more than 60 percent.

0e3a0832c69db0267566b3341ceaa70eff014899: I think there is roughly a 35 percent chance that Assange leaves the UK between now and July 15th, 2019. The reason being is that Assange got a year in jail in England for skipping bail to avoid an extradition to Sweden to fight a rape case. That sentence alone would suggest that Assange will still be in the UK come July 15th. Even though I do believe that Assange will eventually be extradited to the United States, I don't believe that it will happen this soon. Extradition  requests can be a lengthy process and there is a lot of legal red tape that has to be addressed before this can proceed. In addition, there is another country besides the United States who may want to extradite Assange and so this also complicates the process and will probably ensure that Assange stays in the UK for at least a year.

0e3a0832c69db0267566b3341ceaa70eff014899: I think my thinking on this issue was a little conservative. Now that the United States have obtained the possessions that Assange was forced to leave behind at the Embassy, I think they will use this information to expedite Mr. Assange's relocation to the United States to stand trial. I think this is a foregone conclusion and obtaining his documents and files from the Ecuadorian embassy will be the smoking gun they need to get Assange into American custody by July 15th.

66f8aaf95b42f131fe8c4875ec110ea8f91f18a6: There has been a great deal of displeasure in Russia recently with President Putin and the Russian Government. President Putin's approval rating has plummeted recently, hitting its lowest point since he first came to power in 2000. A recent poll by the independent organization Levada shows that 53% of Russian citizens want Putin removed from office. Not only are they unhappy with Putin, but also with the Russian government as a whole. Also in a poll by Levada, results show that the public also wants the government, which is headed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to be ousted. The current government approval rating, according to Levada, is 43% and has been consistently falling since 2014 when it was at a high of 66%. Since January of this year, the government approval rating has hovered between 38% and 42%. Based on this data, it appears that over time, the approval rating for the Russian government has been falling, and it looks like this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. Because of the decline, it does not seem very likely that the approval rating will be rise to levels above 44 any time soon. Most likely it appears that it will remain between the 40 and 44 range, with a small chance of falling even further below 40.

In June 2018, an outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) was declared in Papua New Guinea following laboratory confirmation of cVDPV1 isolation in two healthy communities. Since the declaration, a total of 26 confirmed cVDPV1 cases have been reported in nine provinces.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said recently that the epidemic is fairly under control. The declaration of Polio outbreak has yet not lifted.

The outbreak is because vaccination rates across the country remain too low, Because of a multitude of factors including inadequate access to healthcare, infant vaccination against polio was as low as 44% in 2017.

Even so, it would seem to me that these incidents revolve more around opportunistic factors than anything to which we might easily apply a statistical analysis. Other two-month periods I looked at had 4, 6, 11, 14, and 8 incidents (I just jotted down those numbers and don't want to go back to see which periods were which now), so there wasn't any obvious pattern.

Since this question began, they have taken some actions that might have violated the JCPOA, but have not made any real moves to withdraw from the agreement. Recently, the U.S. extended sanction waivers for foreign companies working in Iran's nuclear program, effectively keeping one portion of the deal alive despite withdrawing from it over a year ago. Iran's foreign minister Zarif has also called for the U.S. to return to the deal, which gives the impression that the country is still committed to the JCPOA for the time being. It's possible that they might withdraw if they don't get the response they want from the U.S., but if this happens, I doubt that it will happen before 30 November.

In July 2018, preparations for the implementation of large scale immunization activities and intensified surveillance measures began. It will more than likely be taken care of by November.","[0.9,0.09999999999999998]","['Yes', 'No']",[0],1.62

So because of the trade wars neither side is going to actually launch an attack, if they did, nobody gets any of the money owed either party and we all know, it's about the money.

So China will do this, and the US will do that but both sides are secretly just putting on a show for the public.

The Chinese Defense Ministry posted a statement online in response to the operation saying the US warship ""trespassed into waters off China's Xisha Islands without permission of the Chinese government.""

3d539b1c3b04f69dddf20c02ce62ccbd27ed5683: North Korea has made at least 4 test launches of ICBMs since 2016. In 2016, it also made 4 test launches of medium range missiles in 2017. Without doing launches, North Korea also tests its engines on the ground, which don't count as a launch. Since 2017, North Korea has only made short range launches.
<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_Korean_missile_tests"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_Korean_missile_tests</a>

With less tension with South Korea, over its openness towards reunification, and less of a need to make statements over new missile technology, North Korea doesn't seem to have any medium or ICBM launches planned.

With attention given to Kim Jong Un by President Trump, no new medium or longer range missiles to debut, and with friendlier relations with the US and S. Korea in general, it's unlikely that North Korea will launch a medium or longer range missile before the end of September.","[0.2,0.8]","['Yes', 'No']",[0],0.08

I don't think this is likely to happen due to the fact that I do not think China is interested in a war to happen.

60e0edd6fcab148258ffe1a32f4dd22ac6ef0e07: Per the OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report, Venezuela's crude oil production has seen considerable fluctuation since 2017. Looking at the numbers for Q3 2018, Q4 2018, and Q1 2019, crude oil production had dropped to 1,272tb/d, then further to 1,191, and then even further to 966. However, looking at the monthly numbers for early 2019 shows that production had been fairly steady in January and February (1,151 and 1,021, respectively), but then dropped significantly in March, to 732. Given these fluctuations, I believe there is a chance that production may rise above 710 by October, but will likely continue to drop further.

However, he could very well be extradited. This seems unlikely in the US. However in Sweden, the case against Assange for rape has been reopened and lawyers are seeking his extradition. This seems like a very short time line of 2 months, but it is very well possible. Therefore, I give it above a 50% chance.

It seems like a matter of time that Assange will be given to the US or Sweden, and the UK is simply deciding who to choose. The only mitigating factor is the timeline of July 15th and the fact that Assange has already been sentenced to a year in prison in the UK

There needs to be a terror attack of some sort or something bad to happen to Canadian citizens who are visiting over there. Like the US, dual Canadian/Chinese citizens can face trouble when traveling over there. Those laws arent really enforced though. There is also an opportunity for terror attacks according to the UK government. Foreigners arent really the targets over there though.

The Security Council has a history of inaction from trying not to escalate tensions or show favoritism to one side . China says both sides should stop any action over Kashmir. India has instituted a communications blackout and security lockdown there, so protests have been ongoing. The S.C. should act quickly as both parties are nuclear armed .

The IEA said that prices shouldn't go much higher as global demand seems to be slowing and there is an oversupply of oil on the market, driving prices down or keeping them from rising higher. Prices have been above $60 for the last month now, and have risen above $67, which seem to be a good upper and lower limit given the previous news. The price is currently around $63. The general trend has been up, but the immediate trend seems to be down a bit.

People are predicting that gold will rise quite a bit over the rest of the year, but not a drastic increase in the next couple of weeks. More of a slow steady climb.  I don't see any information that gold is going to decrease a lot to reach less than 1240.  Also it is going to take a while for it to hit 1380.  I see it holding mostly steady with slight deviations in the short term with a gradual increase throughout the rest of the year.

Based on this distribution it is clear that the probability isn't distributed evenly over the months but is actually highly variable based on external factors . Looking at the news, it appears that there is reported conflict between Vietnam, the US and China. Looking at past news reports it seems likely, but not certain that this event would lead to riots.

According to irrawaddy.com, Hlaing met with India's prime minister to strengthen the relationship between the two countries.  It went very well.  I don't see any need for Hlaing to lose his position as Myanmar's Commander-in-Chief.

Together, they have abused their power and been accused for taking wrongful acts against the people of Myanmar.  According to the Washing Post, these actions are just a normal part of the country.  No group has really taken a stand against Min Aung Hlaing and the military.  They simply are running the country how they want.  The US has recently sanction him but it really doesn't seem to have much effect.  I do not see Min Aung Hlaing losing any power much less his position in the military.","[0.02,0.98]","['Yes', 'No']",[0],0.0008

He's said he's not trying to push for a no-deal Brexit, but the EU has significant leverage here which Johnson can't control as well as he'd like.

Boris Johnson also tried to call for a general election, but didn't get the 2/3 majority vote needed to do so. This makes it much more likely now that a bill blocking no-deal Brexit can get passed. Nothing is certain though. Anything could happen at this point, so I'll be updating my forecast as events unfold in the House of Commons.

It's hard to say whether an extension is likely. Boris Johnson seems to be optimistic about a possible deal, if the EU summit next week goes well. Another possible outcome is that there is a shorter extension granted to the UK, in the case that the government needs a bit more time to iron out a deal in progress.

30accf5b57b16bac102f1f0cea5ddef28b2ab478: I'm not quite sure if this question refers to it staying at a Level 2 or being upgraded beyond that. As of January of this year it's been at a level 2 because of the Zika Virus. They can only upgrade it to a level 3 or 4 at this point. I'm going with the assumption it is referring to issuing a new, higher level health notice. Because of that I don't believe it will be upgraded. Zika is the only issue noted and that's not something which will probably cause a raised health alert status. Because of that I'm putting the chance at 15%.

Despite the conditions that have created these tensions and the irrationality/unpredictability of Turkey's president, I don't think there will be an actual military conflict between the two nations. To state it plainly, Cyprus has no hope of winning any sort of conflict with Turkey. It lacks the military, economic, and diplomatic might that would required to win. I think these two nations will come to the table and bargain out their differences.

I really see this election being a close call between Peter Mutharika and Lazarus Chakwera. If Lazarus Chakwera can rally up the support that he need's within the coming week's leading up to election it is very much so possible that he wins especially if he is making bold promises that captivates the poor in his country which cover's at least 50% of Malawai. 

The chances of the rest of the candidates is quite slim though considering the fact they appear to not have much popularity based on the new's results that I went through. Right now I see the election slightly in favor of Peter Mutharika since he beat Lazarus Chakwera during the 2014 election.

There is no evidence that the price should fluctuate in April 2019. However, it is worth noting that in late 2018, the price hovered around $1.40 for most of 2018. Due to several factors, fuel prices in this region are some of the highest in the world. Based on that evidence, I do not believe the price will substantially increase in April.

Based on this information I will forecast a 40 % chance of 1 , a 45% chance of 2  and a 15% chance of 0 major hurricanes happening between May 24, 2019 and June 24, 2019.

As a global community, we must ask ourselves: Can Yemen afford to lose a generation of children? Can the region — and indeed, the world — afford the instability and crushing poverty that will result? What will happen if Yemen descends into a full-blown famine? What happens now that the water table is so low that the small aquifers are below the required well depth? In some ways, this can be worse than famine, as lack of water can sicken and kill children. Are we prepared to subject a generation of children — and perhaps, their children — to this bleak future? How long will we continue allowing Yemen to slide into oblivion? With this kind of pressure being applied on the issue I will vote 100%

This a faster rate than earlier in the epidemic. Some say the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo still does not warrant the declaration of a global health emergency and are moderately optimistic that this outbreak can be brought into control within a foreseeable time period. Others feel it's a mistake because it could draw in more international attention, political will and support. I am optimistic they will get this under control and not have to declare a PHEIC before 15 July 2019 so I am making my probability reasonably low at this point.

In a recent poll 67% of the people questioned said they were in favor of Merkel remaining Chancellor until it is time for a new election.  She has high approval ratings, a solid grasp on her position and is one of the most powerful women in the world.  The only way I see her experiencing a significant leadership is due to her health as she was seen shaking in public for the third time in less than a month but she has stated that she is fine and has been working through some things.  She will not seek reelection in 2021 so, even if her health starts to decline, I think she will remain as Chancellor until that time.

Apparently, there are still diverging opinions between Morocco and the Polisario Front that keep a resolution over this complicated conflict from happening. Since this has been going on for decades and each side has decided their own goals for proposing solutions in the upcoming talks, I think there is a medium chance that there will be at least one more talk between May 23, 2019 and November 29, 2019, with a slightly lower chance that there could be at least two within that time frame. I feel that they want another talk as soon as possible, so I have a low percentage for 0, but I don't think it will be 3 or more, so I also have that low.

e76396ab01835f5d4e5ce0b92ab5b76a6c25ad4e: The resignation of Horst Kohler, the German UN envoy of the Western Sahara conflict, back in May 2019 has still left a lasting effect that many feel has affected the chance at a peaceful resolution since he generated so much hope for one.

Just recently, it was claimed that Morocco, backed strongly by France through its passive UN Security role, is obstructing efforts by the UN to solve the Western Sahara conflict with the Polisario Front and pushing a final solution.

The Polisario Front also accused Morocco of being involved in the death of 9 newborns. This was denied by the regional health division in early June 2019.

So much turmoil is going on between both countries and with the UN, so it seems highly likely that all of this will significantly hinder talks. I have changed my predictions to reflect that there is a larger chance that no talks will occur and that there is no chance of 3 or more occurring between May 23, 2019 and November 29, 2019.

MINURSO just reported on October 31, 2019 that the Security Council just voted for a mandate extension on the UN mission in the Western Sahara, adopting Resolution 2494. This resolution is supposed to give the UN and MINURSO time to align and develop a compromise so that they can come to a resolution in this difficult conflict. The Council still wants negotiations to resume and cooperation between the parties and MINURSO, and there are still pushes for resolving this as quickly as possible.

Since this was just voted on, the talks were put on hold until this vote, and the deadline is only in a few weeks, I don't foresee any more formal talks happening any time soon to resolve this heated conflict.

Israel, despite its tough talk and inflexible behavior toward many countries, wants to lay claim to the bordering land, and Lebanon, Hezbollah in particular is motivated by a need for capital. Recognition from Hezbollah helps legitimize Israel's claim and access to gas and oil resources in the disputed area will help Lebanon regain some of what it has lost from U.S. sanctions against Iran.

Taiwan did condemn Chinas actions in Hong Kong but I don't see that being enough to provoke a full fledged attack.

1835d1f63c02b3d62daae6c4f9714c87f4da9dc6: The idea of the Middle East Strategic Alliance has been in the works since 2017 after being proposed by the Trump administration. However, almost no concrete progress has been made since then. Many of the countries involved in the potential alliance have extremely different interests and needs, and the current political climate in the region does not seem like it will have a positive impact on alliance negotiations. On top of this, Egypt's recent withdrawal has added yet another roadblock. I do believe that it's possible for an alliance to be created in the future, but given the current state of the region and the amount of progress made so far, it's highly unlikely that much progress will be made before 30 November. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://arabcenterdc.org/policy_analyses/trumps-doomed-quest-for-a-middle-east-strategic-alliance/"">http://arabcenterdc.org/policy_analyses/trumps-doomed-quest-for-a-middle-east-strategic-alliance/</a>

7540940a153bff02b111abf59e05fdfe133fde24: Although Merkel´s approval ratings have been lower recently, she is still a very respected leader in her country, and around the world.  That said, there have been some signs pointing to her perhaps departing earlier than the end of her term (in roughly two years time)  She has been grooming her preferred successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, by installing her in a new high profile position to give her more public exposure leading up to the next elections.  Merkel has also had a series of odd seeming health related issues lately, which are causing some to believe she may be ill, and planning to step down ahead of schedule.  She will be taking her summer break shortly, and I think after that time, it will become clearer what her future intentions are.  For now, barring any major health issue, I see little chance of her leadership being disrupted within the given time frame.

His opponent, Jeremy Hunt, is against Brexit but says he could negotiate a better deal within the same time frame.

Trump is in the UK right now trying to negotiate a trade deal in advance of the move, and is pushing for Brexit in October as well. I really feel that they will go ahead with Brexit this time and will likely have chosen a successor by then to handle the reins. It was already supposed to happen in March of this year so it's already been postponed.  It's much too early to say with any confidence though until they do choose a new PM.

efb7667b238abae8d968142d6cf0c68131597ec1: Malaysia will work diplomatically with India if it decides to restrict imports of Malaysian palm oil, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Wednesday (Oct 16), according to the state news agency Bernama.

Reuters reported last week that India was considering curbing imports of some Malaysian products, including palm oil, after Kuala Lumpur criticised New Delhi for its actions in Kashmir.

<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-says-will-work-diplomatically-with-india-if-palm-oil-imports-curbed"">https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-says-will-work-diplomatically-with-india-if-palm-oil-imports-curbed</a>

India last month increased customs duty on refined palm oil import from Malaysia by 5% for six months as a measure to safeguard the domestic industry. The duty could be further increased, the people said.

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday said the country won't bring the palm oil issue with India to the World Trade Organization ""at the moment"" and he won't retract his comments claiming India had ""invaded and occupied"" Kashmir.

<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-22/india-said-to-weigh-trade-curbs-on-turkey-malaysia-over-kashmir"">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-22/india-said-to-weigh-trade-curbs-on-turkey-malaysia-over-kashmir</a>

Though the SEAI may not back down, the Indian and Malaysian governments are likely to work out a deal to avoid sanctions. While this may include levelling the playing field and ending Malaysia's special privileges for palm oil, neither country is interested in letting nationalist disputes derail RCEP.

6201cd3c72dbd08b2680c19c017c8736ebb2c81b: I grossly overestimated last time as to whether or not an attack would occur between Venezuela and Columbia. While I do think an attack is likely in the future, I believe there will be events that precipitate this event, and the knowledge therein will spurn said attacks at a much later time. The scary thing is Maduro is ready for a US intervention/attack.

China seems to have its hand full with Hong Kong and related protests right now, and is already facing international pressure because of this. I doubt they would bring any more attention on themselves by attacking Taiwan in this time frame.

e1212a0abb5e7be014d6c2ecc1f794c50b86c3c6: I make this forecast because his current disapproval rate is 64%. There is a good chance it may rise.  He is currently polling at 26% favorability and it doesn't appear to be getting better. Many lost jobs and pension guarantees as a result of his SNCF reforms.  There have been vast, violent protests, defacement of monuments,  and people killed as a result of anger towards policies he has implemented. 

I think his unfavorability will rise between July and August.

I am sorry to say the reason I believe this will happen is not political but medical. There have been numerous news reports of Chancellor Merkel having tremors. ""The German leader has suffered three bouts of uncontrolled shaking recently while standing at public ceremonies"" and now has been photographed nodding off during a state function. In my nonlicensed opinion, this may be something as simple as low blood sugar or reaction to a new medicine to more severe cases of neurological conditions that I won't mention without proof.

I don't think that it will get above 920 based on the current data, but there is almost equal chances of the price being in the other 4 categories. June 25 is still too far away to get an accurate prediction of Platinum prices, so it will be necessary to keep an eye on the prices and update my prediction over the next month.

Given that the price for the past couple weeks has been in the $790 to $830 range, I believe that the price of Platinum on June 25th is likely to be in the same range.

17f5c9170dd09ddd15ebaeea42c7bfb81dea4cda: The Nikkei has been hovering between 22000 and 22600 for the last month. However, despite recent growth, Japan has recently downgraded its assessment of the economy. With the implementation of the the recent hike in the consumption tax, this will likely curtail any large rise that may happen. The Nikkei will probably remain around the 22600 level and be unlikely to rise too much before the end of October.

3278e510a7f8113185dce898c31d57067c9b3605: Acting US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Satterfield has been working to bring Israel and Lebanon to the negotiating table. The good news is that Hezbollah, which is the main powerbroker in Lebanon's government, isn't creating barriers to potential talks. Lebanon's government is struggling to rein in its deficit, giving a new impetus to its search for energy revenues. There are just a couple of sticking points in the framework of negotiations. I expect those to be ironed out. There is a good chance a meeting will take place before the end of August.

There are sticking points in the negotiations, but the root of the problem stems from the deep distrust from all sides which will take a long time to work through. Lebanon does not want U.S. involvement, and Israel does not want UN involvement. I am lowering the probability to 10%

3278e510a7f8113185dce898c31d57067c9b3605: After meeting with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington last Thursday, Prime Minister Saad Hariri said he had confirmed Beirut's commitment to continuing the negotiation process on land and maritime borders launched by the US government. He also said that he hoped for a final decision possibly in September. So the door is now open, but no date has been set for official talks between Israel and Lebanon. Perhaps a deal could be done with U.S. mediation without Israel and Lebanon meeting with each other directly. It's difficult to predict this one, because the deep distrust in that part of the world often turns optimism into nothing. However, I am increasing the probability to 20% based solely on the encouraging language used by Lebanon.

Lebanon's president said the drone strikes were a declaration of war that justified a military response. I have adjusted the probability of a meeting down to 0%.

f69bbf75e8a6bccb6cd1da312a9c3726ddb72275: It's very unlikely that a lethal attack will occur anytime soon within Turkey because their leader was just killed and a bunch of arrests were just made as well. If a terrorist attack does occur within Turkey, it will most likely be well after November if we consider the fact that ISIS is going to have to put a new leader in.

Asked on the sidelines if he thought Saudi Arabia had paid a big enough price for its actions, he told TIME ""I think they have. I think they have paid a big reputational price and there have been profound diplomatic consequences."" So as now Saudi is off the hook and will rebuild their rep but know threats seem to be at large for Saudi Arabia.

North Korea has the backing of China, which has already said that if a foreign nation attacked North Korea, they would respond in kind. And while North Korea wants to make a show of power, they won't cross a line that would practically be suicide for his regime.

60b6e716c68361c948297ea453838fdbccad5c73: The most recent run up in the Nikkei 225 has resulted in the volatility index dropping below $16 as of Friday 9/20. This follows a sharp spike late in August, caused in large part by trade disagreements between the United States and China.

I've been thinking we are going to see a significant drop in securities across the globe and, so far, I've largely been wrong.  That's not going to stop me from still believing it's going to happen. Eventually I'm going to be correct, it's just that I may be wrong 100 times before it comes to fruition. 

Because of my staunch belief that there will be a correction in the market, I think the VIX rises up from here.

NATO was specifically created to fight off any Russian attacks many American allies are members including Turkey. Now we have Russians installing their defense system alongside side NATO systems, in fact they train Turkish pilots on the F35 but not no more. So Erdogan will most certainly be sanctioned by the US and likely removed from NATO. Will this lead to Erdogan to resign? Maybe but I doubt it pretty bad. So I give it a 5 percent chance of it happening.

1b906e8e8e951ffa6eb115f5b77e335d6c670c64: Accordin to all violent data statistics recorded in Vietnam for the year of 2019, January was a really bad month. But given all the new year celebrations that was to be expected. Holidays are always a source for terrorism targeting. In order to try and average out the riots expectations for the Summer, it's important to note how many riots have already occurred and why they occurred. There were 5 riots in January because of violent demonstrations. Many peaceful protests took place in February, with the exception of 1 mob riot. March saw 2 violent riots against the Labour Group. April and May though have been quiet for riots, but May has seen numerous protests and attacks against civilians by the police. Summer could see an uptick in violent riots as the months get warmer.

Half of them were peaceful protests which only resulted in arrests and there was one occasion when there was police violence against civilians. But there have been no riots of any kind recorded. The deadline is up in only a few days and there are not any major holidays or political outgoings that would make for a perfect storm of violent activity to take place. There have also been no terrorism incidents in the country to take note of.

eb0fe8848fc63a53c45a96e2cd02b7c3fa094bce: Egypt has protests about the economy and the government is to blame. So far though no fatalities have occured from the protests. The Egyptian government has stamped out these protests by arresting everybody involved and this led to jail overcrowding because people who aren't even involved are being incarcerated. There is a chance someone will die in detention but not from protests necessarily. So I gave it a 10% chance for that reason because even in more modern countries like the US detainees die in camps for immigrants. So it's not impossible someone will die from protesting because of incarceration.

Hezbollah has already stated that they are gearing up for an attack against Israel and they have stated that they will enter Israel in the future. 

Attacks have been occurring between both countries for years. Israel drones have already been shot down by the Hezbollah within the last month. Since the end of November is about a month and a half away I'm going to remain optimistic that a lethal confrontation does not occur in the near future.

bc40634ed7c23f191ed59e4704278a0372776ae3: President Trump has already shown he is willing to make the difficult but necessary steps to curb immigration.  The issue is not whether the signing country desires the agreement, but  whether or not the US can coerce agreement.  In September, foreign aid was drastically cut to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador for failing to address immigration through these nations.  Guatemala then quickly signed a safe third country agreement.  How long can these other countries survive with reduced US aid?  Longer than Guatemala it seems, but probably not much longer.  

Of course another relevant question is what exactly does the US desire?  Mexico has continued to refuse to sign such an agreement but after a tariff scare the nation rapidly deployed new measures to address migrating peoples.  But these poorer nations do not have the same means.  Instead, the US, with plenty of leverage, will push for this legal framework to accomplish the same goal without having to rely on beleaguered foreign police forces.

bc40634ed7c23f191ed59e4704278a0372776ae3: Honduras and El Salvador have now signed such agreements.  Along with Guatemala these nations effectively barricade central America.  However, many illegal immigrants originate from these countries and therefore may not ""pass through"" a safe-third country.  Thus, Mexico continues to crown jewel of such agreements.  But Mexico is adamant that they will not agree and i am not sure how much the administration is really willing to pressure them.  Nicaragua and Costa Rica are geographically on the table as well, but relatively fewer illegal immigrants come from nations to the south of these countries.
